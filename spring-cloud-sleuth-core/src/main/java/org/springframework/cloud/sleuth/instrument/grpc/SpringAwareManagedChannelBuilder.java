/**
 * This is a Spring-aware managed channel builder that wraps the static entry points of
 * gRPC's ManagedChannelBuilder to allow the configuration of the builder to be influenced
 * by the Spring Context. All GrpcManagedChannelBuilderCustomizer instances included in
 * the application context will have the opportunity to customize the builder.
 *
 * NOTE: There is nothing "Sleuth-specific" about this, however, there is currently not a
 * good spring abstraction for client-side gRPC. Ideally, this could be moved up into
 * grpc-spring-boot-starter or a new project could be created
 * "spring-grpc"/"spring-cloud-grpc"?
